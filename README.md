# Frogger
This a simple frogger game based on HTML5 features and native JavaScript.
The main engine was taken from Udacity OO JavaScript course.
The goal of the game is to get to the to river, at the same time player should avoid a contact with bugs.
The basic functionality asked by Udacity teachers was extended by adding game menu, health/lose mechanics and rules.
- Move your player with ← → ↑ ↓ buttons.
- Every contact with bugs would cost you a 1 life.
- If you went out of life you - lose.

### You can demo run this app with [gh-pages](http://lempiy.github.io/frogger).
